# Sample Web Client

This is a sample Web Client for NF Image upload to FROGv.4-datastore. It exploits [JQuery-File-Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload)
[(documentation)](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki) in order to upload large files in chunks.

There are two versions of the client, pure jQuery and an AngularJS one.
